# weatherApp
A simple weather app using api.

TO use the search function, uou will need to obtain an API key to use this app.

Please go to https://openweathermap.org/ and sign in to create one.

Once you have the key, please input it in the file `main.js` in line 30.

There are a few issues I am still working on but it is a work in progress.

To fix includes:
- layout (I have forgotten how to do flex box haha)
- fix fav button to only save when clicked, at the moment it saves all
- possibly update the weather comment on the bottom of temperature

Please provide any feedback.
Thank you!
